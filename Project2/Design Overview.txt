Design Overview
We'll implement a service-oriented architecture (SOA) using ASP.NET Framework. The application will be divided into several services:

Admin Service: Handles train, station, and schedule management.
Booking Service: Manages train bookings.
Search Service: Handles train search functionalities.
API Service: Provides endpoints for external parties (travel agents).
We'll also create two client applications:

Admin Web Application: For managing trains, stations, and schedules.
User Web Application: For searching trains and booking tickets.
